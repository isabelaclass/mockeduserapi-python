# 🖥️ User Management API

This repository contains a simple User Management API built with Python and Flask. The API allows for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on mock user data.

## 📌 About the Project  
The User Management API provides endpoints to manage user data. The project includes:

- 🚀 **GET** endpoint to retrieve user information by ID  
- ✏️ **POST** endpoint to add new users to the mock database  
- 🔄 **PUT** endpoint to update existing user data  
- 🗑️ **DELETE** endpoint to remove a user from the mock database  
- 💾 Mock database handling to simulate MySQL interactions  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- Python 3.9
- Flask for creating the API  
- Docker for containerization
